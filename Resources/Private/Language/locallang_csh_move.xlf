                <source>The configuration of the tables and the page ids of the source records and their destination page ids are stored in a XML file. This XML file has an entry about all page ids with their old and their new value. All records of these tables with any of these source page ids will be moved to the corresponding destination page ids. The XML file contains pairs of source and destination page ids.
                You must enter the path and the filename of this XML file. E.g. fileadmin/extension/move/move_mytable.xml . You can set a option to change the behaviour from move into copy.</source>
